            <p>In 1999, Antony Das established a tobacco factory called <b>Das & Co.</b>As the children of Antony, <b>Leo</b> and <b>Elisa Das</b> did the dirty work for them to run the business smoothly. Apart from that, Leo also created a cigarette flavor called D-Slash. Being a strong believer in the occult, Antony tried to sacrifice Elisa based on his Reverend's advice (even though Harold chose to sacrifice Leo), as this would have allowed their tobacco products to take off. Enraged, Leo sets fire to all of Harold's drugs, but Harold manages to kill Elisa and Antony shoots Leo, who was since presumed to be dead.

                <p><b>Life as Parthiban</b></p>
                Leo somehow survived and left his life as Leo Das and decided to start over as a new person, thus becoming Parthiban. During a trekking at Munnar, he met Sathya and both fell in love. Years later, they got married and have kids, a son named Siddharth "Siddhu" and a daughter named Mathi "Chintu", settled in Theog. Parthiban started a café called Café Wild Beans. Apart from running a café, Parthiban also becomes an animal rescuer in Theog, Himachal Pradesh. One day, Parthi's friend, Joshy Andrews, a forest ranger, calls him to help tame a spotted hyena threatening the townsfolk. With Siddhu's help, Parthi manages to tranquilize the hyena. He purposely avoids public attention over this incident and adopts the hyena after it calms down, naming it Subramani.
                
                <p><b>Return of Dark Side</b></p>
                Parthiban about to kill 5 robbers in cafe
                One night, Parthi and Chintu are at the café when Shanmugam, a robber, and his men arrive to rob it. Parthi tries to appease them by giving them money, but one of the gang members makes a move on his employee Shruthi. Enraged, Parthi beats up all of them. When one of them attempts to kill Chintu, Parthi guns all of them down without hesitation, but later has an emotional breakdown. Initially arrested, Parthi is released for having committed the murders in self-defense, but his photograph appears in newspapers all over India. One such image is seen by notorious gangster Harold Das in Telangana, who informs his elder brother, Antony Das about him. Antony immediately leaves with his men for Theog.
                
                Meanwhile, Shanmugham's relatives attempt to kill Parthi and his family, prompting him to request a high-ranking, armed police officer from Tamil Nadu to be sent to his house for protection. Parthi's request is granted as Napoleon, having been promoted recently following his heroics with Dilli in Trichy, is assigned to protect his family. On meeting Parthi, Antony insists that Parthi is his son, Leo Das, who was assumed to be dead, but Parthi vehemently denies this. Antony threatens him to accept his identity and surrender or face the consequences. Antony meets Sathya and tells her that Leo is a mass murderer, prompting her to dig into Parthi's past. At the same time, Joshy starts digging into Leo's past and learns about his friend, Hridayaraj D'Souza, who was arrested and is to be hanged in three days.
                
                <p><b>Parthiban fighting in Das & Co</b></p>
                On meeting with Hridayaraj, Joshy learns about Leo's past and gets convinced that Parthi is not Leo, while Sathya also gets definitive proof of the same. Meanwhile, Antony kidnaps Siddhu and tells him that he will sacrifice Siddhu as he could not sacrifice Elisa with his own hands. Parthi and Napoleon give chase to Antony and his men, and Parthi eventually catches up with them. He finishes off Antony and his men but does not find Siddhu. Harold learns about Antony's death and calls Parthi to bring Antony's body in return for Siddhu. As Parthi goes to Harold's lair, Harold reveals that he has sent men to kill Sathya and Chintu. However, Parthi already placed traps to the men and if the pass the trap Napoleon, Joshy, and the hyena Subramani finish off all the men. Harold's men attack Parthi at their lair, but he manages to fend them off. As Harold and Parthi engage in a fistfight, Parthi grabs a gun and holds Harold at gunpoint.
                
                At this point, Harold admits that Parthi is not Leo and states that he and his family can walk away freely. However, Parthi starts laughing and finally admits that he is Leo before gunning down Harold, rescuing Siddhu and torching the entire Das & Co. factory. Leo states that he has done nothing good in his past and anyone who insists on knowing his story must either die or already be dead.

                <p><b>Road to Drug-Free Society</b></p>
                    Leo gets a mystery call
                    As peace returns to Parthi's life, he gets a phone call. The caller reveals that he knows Parthiban is Leo and tells him that destroying only his family's Datura factory was not enough to make the society drug-free as drugs are rampant all over India. The caller asks him Parthi to join his gang to stop these drugs dealers and their drugs to make the society a drug- free society. The caller also says that he knows Parthi recognizes his identity, as Parthi sighs in exasperation.
